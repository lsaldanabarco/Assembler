# Assembler
This is the assembler that I created as part of the From Nand To Tetris course.

### 🏁 **Objective**: 
Write an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.

### 🏃🏼‍♂️ **Run Instructions**: 
```python assembler.py prog.asm```

- prog.asm is a program in the symbolic Hack assembly language such as the provided **Rect.asm**
- The program will create a prog.hack file (binary code) in the same directory
   - If you were to translate Rect.asm, you should get a file like the provided **Rect.hack**
